		<h1>The Atomic Age and J. Robert Oppenheimer</h1>
		<div class="col1">
			<p>
				J. Robert Oppenheimer, a key figure in the Manhattan Project during
				World War II, played an integral role in the development of the atomic
				bomb. Renowned as a brilliant physicist, he led the team that
				successfully detonated the first nuclear weapon in 1945.
			</p>
			<p>
				Following the war, Oppenheimer became a vocal advocate for nuclear
				regulation. He opposed the development of the hydrogen bomb, emphasizing
				the need for international control over nuclear power. This stance
				highlighted his commitment to ethical scientific practices in the
				post-war era.
			</p>
			<p>
				However, during the Red Scare, Oppenheimer faced severe accusations of
				communist sympathies. This led to a controversial public hearing that
				stripped him of his security clearance, tarnishing his reputation.
				Despite these challenges, Oppenheimer's contributions to physics and his
				influence on nuclear policy remained significant until his death in
				1967.
